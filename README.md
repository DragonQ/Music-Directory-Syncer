# Music Folder Syncer

Music Folder Syncer is a Windows application that allows a directory of music files to be synced to another, according to certain rulesets:

  - Tags being present
  - Tags having certain values
  - File type

Lossless audio files can be converted to a chosen lossy format using ffmpeg if desired to save space, e.g. on a mobile device. Once you've made your synced directory, you can use [any folder syncing application] to copy it to a mobile device, for example.

Music Folder Syncer will run quietly in the background watching your chosen source directory for changes, and it will update your sync directory on-the-fly.
